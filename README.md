## Project Description ##

The idea behind this project is to analyse the AirBnB NY dataset, find insights about the listings, and generate visualizations using Tableau.

New York will always be a hot destination, we all grew up watching several tv shows and movies showcasing NY, so I wanted to make this project about this amazing city (to know where I should stay when I visit it :) )

to achieve that, the breakdown of the project goes as described below:

 * Data cleaning: A deepdive into the dataset, and get it ready for EDA
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Aims to appraoch the data from both a qualitative and a quantitative approach for main insights
 * Export the cleaned data into Tableau in a CSV file, and generate there the visualizations

## Questions ##

1. Find a metric "currency" in this dataset to describe everything else.

2. Which are the hottest places where people stay in NY? 

3. What insights can we get from this dataset?

## Dataset ##

The dataset is acquired online through the use of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data "Kaggle")

## Workflow ##

First of all, was to get a dataset to which I could apply several processes:

  * Data Cleaning
  * Data Analysis
  * Data Visulalisations

New York will always be a hot destination, we all grew up watching several tv shows and movies showcasing NY, and we all love the city, after searching for a suitable dataset on the internet, I found this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data "Kaggle")

Then what's explained in this file was applied

## Organization ##

My repo has the following folders and structure:

your-project folder:
* AirBnB paper.ipynb
* Zak AirBnB NY.key (presentation made with Keynote)
* AB_NYC_2019.csv (original dataset from kaggle)
* AB_NYC_2019_clean.csv (dataset after data-cleaning)
