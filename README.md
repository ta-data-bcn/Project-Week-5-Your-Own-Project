## Project Description

In this project i would like to find the cities where there is more economic dependence on tourism, and therefore its affectation by the covid virus.

## Questions & Hypotheses

I will try to find those answers by comparing the GDP per capita with the average price per night of AirBnB listings for different
popular cities.

## Dataset

I used datasets from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html for each city AirBnB listings, and then i scrapped from wikipedia the top 300 cities with higher GDP.

## Workflow

First i organized my steps with kanbas board, secondly i started with gathering and cleaning the data, then i started interpreting the data
with plots and tableau visualizations. Finally i worked on my presentation and technical report.

## Organization

I used a kanbas board (trello) to organize my work.

My folder has one folder for all the data and another for the scraping, data cleaning, and ploting analysis.
