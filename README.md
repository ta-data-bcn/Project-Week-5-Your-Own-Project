## Project Description
This project takes a look at the correlation between the velocity and the spin rate of all the pitches trown during the 2019 MLB season, and the relation between the spin rate and the outcomes of each pitch.  

## Questions & Hypotheses
The questions that I wanted to answer with this project are: 

- Is there any correlation between the spin rate of the ball and the speed which is thrown? In other words, does a higher spin rate means higher velocity?
- Do pitches that produce a swinging strike have a higher spin rate that pitches that are put in play? 

For the hypothesis testing I assumed the null hypothesis that the mean spin rate of the pitches that produced a swinging strike is equal to the pitches that produced a ball in play. 

My alternative hypothesis is that pitches that produced a swinging strike have a higher mean than the pitches that did not. 

## Dataset
For this project I used the 2019 statcast dataset whith records of all the pitches thrown during that season, which includes, the release spin rate, release velocity and outcomes. 

You can find the dataset on the data folder in this repository.
