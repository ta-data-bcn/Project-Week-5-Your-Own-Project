## Project Description
The Startup Ecosystem has been flourishing over the past decades. As Startups are essential leaders of today's innovation as well as potential employers for Bootcamp Alumi's, I decided to dedicate my second project to investigating past developments in the Startup Ecosystem, Correlations of different Parameters and prospect future developments in order to determine future success factors. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
Questions I would like to answer in my project : 
- How did the number of companies founded by year develop over time?
- How many companies are there by sector and country?
- How was the growth of number of companies founded by sector in the past years?
- How is the expected growth for the coming years by sector?
- What is the probability of being acquired by sector?
- What is the probability of being funded and acquired by sector?
- Which sector pays the most for acquisition?
- How many Unicorns are there by sector and Country?
- Hypothesis 1: There is a positive correlation between the amount of companies founded and the amount of funding by sector.
- Hypothesis 2: There is a positive correlation between the amount of companies founded and closed in a sector.
- Hypothesis 3: There is a correlation between the amount of funding and the probability of being acquired.
