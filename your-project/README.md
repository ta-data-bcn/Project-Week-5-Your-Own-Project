## Project Description
Women are underrepresentated in Science, in order to further study this phenomena, the Nobel prizes where took as the starting point to attemp to shed some light in the why.

## Questions & Hypotheses
- Question: Is it true that women are underepresented in STEM? Why is that so?
    - Is the female/male ratio shifted
    - Are there less females in the age of going to university?
    - Are there less females studying a STEM field?
    - Are there less females graduating?

- Hypothesis: it is true that women are underrepresented. 

## Dataset

The data sets where obtained from various sources (described below). Some of the data was obtained with web scrapping but most of it was already downloaded in the form of a csv file.

## Workflow

The workflow followed was simple, going through the questions asked and obtaining individual conclusions in order to obtain a globalized one.

## Organization

The repository includes a .ipynb called data cleaning and analysis that contains all the datasets used. The data sets are cleaned step by step and then the data is analysed and the conclusions are drawns. It also contains another .ipynb file explaining in a more visual way the findings of these project. Apart from that, it has the presentation of the project in a power point format and a couple of folders for the data and the images.
