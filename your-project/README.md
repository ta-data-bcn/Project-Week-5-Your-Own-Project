## Project Description
The objective of this project is choosing a topic that interests me, finding related data, completing an end-to-end analysis and presenting the findings.
During 2020 Covid19, a potentially lethal virus with a huge rate of spreading, has changed the lives of all the people around the world.
It's known that in Spain, since the industrial era, people has migrated gradually but without stop from villages to big cities, increasing the density of 
population in those areas. 
Due to Covid19, spanish government has created a list of mesures to slow down the virus spreading rate. And one of them is the social distance between people.
In this study I will try to explain why, in Catalonia (region of Spain), goverments should invest efforts in reducing the population density in big cities.


## Questions & Hypotheses
1.Hypothesis
	H1.Population density is making the housing price rise
	H2.Population density is making the pollution rise
	H3.Population density is growing for main cities in Catalunya
		h3.1.Government recommendations for Covid19 are not compatible with population expectations


2.Questions
	Q1. Is there a correlation between average price of houses and population density?
	Q2. Is there a correlation between population density of houses and pollution in cities?
	Q3. How long would it take for big cities in Catalunya to reach similar population density as China average?
	
Final question: why should catalan government invest in normalizing population density?

## Dataset
After researching on official datasets of Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia government) and their APIs, the chosen ones were:
a) Central Spanish Government website
https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/serviciosdeprensa/notasprensa/presidencia/Paginas/2020/10042020_buenaspracticas.aspx

b) 'Institut d'Estad√≠stica de Catalunya', the Catalan government official statistics website
https://www.idescat.cat/

c) A pollution focused website provided by Catalan government referred to Catalan area values
http://www.qualitatdelaire.cat/


## Workflow
1. List of interesting topics
2. Research of valuable and reliable data to use for each topic
3. Selecting a definitive topic, create Questions and Hypotheses
4. Download and clean datasets and necessary related information
5. Understand relations between different data values along the years and find correlations between different data
6. Creating plots to visualize and make understanding easier
7. Testing hypotheses and answering questions
8. Producing a presentation for the results
