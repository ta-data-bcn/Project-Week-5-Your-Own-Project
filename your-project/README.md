## Project Description
My project is regarding Autoveichular Accidents that have taken place in the USA between February 2016 and December 2019. 
The project addresses a number of topics including the number of accidents overall, where they took place, when and using statistics,
we suggest potentially why some accidents may have occured due to weather conditions at the time. I also combed datasets from Wikipedia
to correlate seatbelt useage with accident numbers by state. 
Given that many people drive I chose the project as it maybe it would raise awareness to be careful while driving. The dataset also lent itself to visualisation and statistics,
and allowed me to practice my skills in Pandas, Seaborn and Tableau. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
There were a number of a questions, such as what states have the most car accidents? What weather conditions lead to higher occurances of car accidents? 
I also proposed some hypothesis, which I rejected using statistics. These included questions such as "I predict the average lenght of a car accident in the USA
is 1.5 miles".

## Dataset
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) - US Accidents Database Kaggle
[Seat belt laws in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_laws_in_the_United_States) - Information regarding Seatbelts

## Workflow
My work flow consisted of using a combination of Jupyter Notebooks and Tableau to generate visulisations, analyse data and make conclusions.


## Organization
I used a Trello board to map out my project and updated it as I completed / reached certain goals.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
It's composed of a Notebook repository, where the Jupyter notebook is stored.
A folder entitled "Visuals" contains the PNG's created by both Jupyter and Tableau.
I have not uploaded the databases as the main database is over 1Gb in size, however, it's accessible for the link above.


## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
