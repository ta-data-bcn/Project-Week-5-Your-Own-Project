## Project Description
On one hand, This project is about understanding where earth's population growth occurs, meaning in which countries or continents, and which factors affect this growth the most. 
On the other hand, I want to use the data and my analysis to present a possible solution to this issue that is everybody's matter and that everyone should be worrying about at some point.


## Questions & Hypotheses
About this topic I mainly had these three questions:
- Do less developed and less educated countries have a higher population growth than developed ones?
- What is the relationship between the GDP per capita and the population growth of each country? Does an increment of the first have anything to do with a decrease on the latter?
- Could it be that the solution to overpopulation lies on the developed world to help the undeveloped countries get to a confortable lifestyle so they stop growing?

## Dataset
First I was using datasets from many different places, but after two days of trying to clean those datasets and deciding what to do with the NaN values, I started to look for other datasets and thankfully I had succed in finding new datasets from "Our World in Data" by the University of Oxford that only took me some hours to clean and prepared for the analysis.

## Workflow
The workflow has had some ups and downs in the beginning because I had one topic that I couldn't find data about, Then I started with the Overpopulation topic but found some messy datasets that drove me a bit crazy and then I found the good ones and I was ables to starts the preparing to analysis fase. then I did the analysis and I moved on to the tableau to create visualizations. 
Once I had them ready, I did the presentation, the comments on the code and the paper and now I'm doing the readme file.
Only left to practise the presentation further.


## Organization
I created a Trello board to help me organize my project and the time I spend in each task, but got to admit it got a bit out of hand when I was trying to clean the first datasets. (should've realized it before and dive to find the newones faster)

My repository has one folder called Your-code and inside of it there are:
- Good data sources and tables --> the datasets I've used and some tables I created.
- dirty datasources --> the first datasets I found so you can feel free to see how messy they are.
- Gathering_data (Bloopers).ipynb --> which is my cleaning proccess for those first datasets.
- Data_insights_about_Overpopulation.ipynb --> which is the actual project
- this file
