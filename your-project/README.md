## Project Description
My passion for sneakers and the the phenomenon of the reselling culture (cause of the high prices) inspired me to research the topic and try to bring it to the mainstream by putting the resale values into perspective and digging into the causes. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
How expensive can resale sneakers be? Do they have any distinguishible attribute that influences the price? Does the popularity of the collaborator bring any light into it?

## Dataset
Data scrapping the StockX website with Selenium and csv files from Google Trends.
