## Project Description
The project aims to analyse the correlation between the death rate caused by Covid 19 and the vaccination rate globally, by using a t-test

## Questions & Hypotheses
The main hypothesis is that the death rate does decrease if more than 20% of the population are getting vaccinated. 

## Dataset
In order to answer the question the following 2 datasets were used. https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations , https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1195157/umfrage/impfungen-gegen-das-coronavirus-nach-laendern-weltweit/

## Workflow
The reason for choosing this dataset is mainly the societal importance of the topic, therefore I was aiming to work on a meaningful topic. After gathering the dataset I did a cleaning and analysed the data in more detail. After that I did some brainstorming on the most important questions covered by the dataset and started to work on my Hypothesis

## Organization
