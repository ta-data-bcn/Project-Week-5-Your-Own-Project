## Project Description
This projects is about analysing kickstarters platform. The reason I decided to do the project about this theme is because kickstarters is a perfect way to raise funding without having to give up equity and I would like to better understand how they work and to know more about which succeed and which do not.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Which are the projects that succeed the most? What does the success depend on? Were does most investment go to? Is there any trick to make your kickstarter succeed?

## Dataset
The dataset I used is a csv file which I found from a person who had been scrapping the kickstarter platform for months. The data had some issues, but it was pretty clean.

## Workflow
Once I had found the dataset, I cleaned and formated the data, as well as adding many extra columns which would provide me many other points where to head my analysis. Moreover, the first analysis I carried out in a Jupyter notebook file but for the visualization of the data I used Tableau.

## Organization
I organized my work using trello's website, which helped me to have everything prepared with a lot of time in advance.
