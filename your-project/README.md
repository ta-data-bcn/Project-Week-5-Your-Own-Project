## Project Description
This project wants to analyse the way electricity is produced and hence consumed in Spain. The Spanish TSO (Transmission System Operator) is the entity that regulates the balance between generation and demand. By means of data analytics, an exploratory data analysis is developed, to better understand the behaviour of the Spanish electricity market. 

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions

The main questions to be answered in this project are these two:  
- Has the electricity consumption increased since 2014? 
- Is seasonality electricity consumption significant in the Spanish electricity curve? 
- Is there an increase on renewable energy sources (RES) in the electricity share?

## Dataset
The data has been collected from the Spanish TSO website, on the transparency platform. The file type is a csv file, containing the data between 2015 and 2018. Data from 2014 has been obtained from Kaggle.

## Workflow
The defined workflow follows different steps:
1. Topic choice and definition of tasks and questions. 
2. Data acquisition (REE TSO).
3. Data cleaning and export to SQL Workbench
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Hypotheses Testing
6. Data Visualization
7. Answering questions

## Organization
In order to develop this project some organization has been defined:
- All the tasks have been defined and planified using Trello. 
- A mentor has been assigned to follow the development of the project, to provide suggestions and feedback throughout the entire project.
- Good practises has been defined and followed to perform the data analysis:
    - PEP 8 
    - snake_case variables definition
    - All the coding scripts will be done on Jupyter Notebook
    - Visualization done by means of Matplotlib and Seaborn.
