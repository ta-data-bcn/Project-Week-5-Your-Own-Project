## Project Description
With the COVID crisis and the Black Lives Matter movement, there are increasing voices in the media talking about a moment of change and a fear towards new technologies making humans redundant that is driving a social discomfort that derives in increasing mass protests. I was interested in understanding whether it is true that there are more mass protests after the financial crisis than there were in the prior 20 years of welfare state. In order to test whether it is appropriate to focus on global data or whether different regions must be approached differently, I also study the correlation between mass protests and the freedom level that each country has. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
Main question: Are there more mass protests in the years following the financial crisis than in the prior 20 years of welfare state?
If it is true that we are at a moment of change and that we feel uneasy, the answer to this question should be affirmative. 
Supplementary questions for exploration:
- What do people complain about?
- Which countries complain the most?
- Is there a correlation between the level of freedom of the countries and the number of mass protests?

## Dataset
I used the Mass Mobilization Protest dataset from Harvard. This dataset includes data for the period 1990-2019 from all countries around the world with the exception of the United States. Even when I tried to obtain reliable data for mass protests in the US, it was not possible to find extensive enough information. Therefore the US is excluded from this analysis, even when it is expected to have shown a similar behaviour to that of Western European countries.
