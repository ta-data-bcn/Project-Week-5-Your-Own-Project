## Project Description
In times of the Roman Empire, in times of crisis, the strategy of "Panem et Circenses" was applied: cheap food and massive shows to keep the population calm, being Chariot Racing the most popular sport. In these modern times, has soccer replaced Chariot Racing in the "Panem et Circenses" equation? Let's find out this through the data.

## Questions & Hypotheses
1. Are Broadcasting Companies the New Emperors?
2. Do fans still go to the stadium in times of crisis?
3. Are Football Clubs immune to times of crisis?
4. In which player profile do Football Clubs spend their money?

## Dataset
The data was collected from websites specialized in transfer data (www.transfermarkt.com), in football data (www.worldsoccer.com), in generic data (www.statista.com) and in economic indicators data (www.datosmacro.com).

## Workflow
The general workflow was: 
1. Get the data 
2. Clean and organize the data with Python
3. Explore and Plot the data with Tableau
4. Prepare a video-presentation
5. Write a Medium article

## Organization
The repositoy has 4 different folder: the code folder with the python notebook from data cleaning, the data folder with all the raw data obtained from the different sources, images folder with all the images used to do the presentation and the article, and the presentation folder with the final video.
