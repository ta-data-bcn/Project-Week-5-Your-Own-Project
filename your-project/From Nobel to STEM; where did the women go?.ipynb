    "The gender gap in the Nobel prizes seem to be partly explained by the fact that fewer women pursue a career in Chemistry and Physics and even fewer as researchers in the field, specially researcher publishing the findings.\n",
    "Regarding the Medicine prize, although more females are enrolling in Health and welfare degrees, not many of them research on the topic and therefore do not publish results.\n",
    "To conclude, it seems that the differences career path choice in females and males are not produced by a difference skills in maths and science (PISA scores prove that) indicating that perhaps sociocultural factors could be the explanation."
