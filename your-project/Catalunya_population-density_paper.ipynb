    "Rural exodus, an old process accelerated with the Industrial Revolution and, above all, from the second half of the twentieth century, refers to the emigration from the countryside to the city. It is usually considered as a special type of migration because it involves not only changing place of residence, but also profession, for more than obvious reasons, given the great geographical differences that exist between the opportunities, number and characteristics of different types of occupation that exist in the countryside in relation to the city.\n",
