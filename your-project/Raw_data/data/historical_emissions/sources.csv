Recap data name, source organization
Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","As of December 2019, CAIT Historical Emission data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 185 countries and the European Union (EU) for the period 1990-2016, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks.  Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. See http://cait.wri.org/docs/CAIT2.0_CountryGHG_Methods.pdf for details regarding data source and methodology."
