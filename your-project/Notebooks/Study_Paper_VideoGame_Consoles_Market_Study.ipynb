    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop KPIs to measure main videogame console performances from 2000 in order to provide new insights over the videogame console game scene & market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project relies on the so-called \"metacritics\" score, an aggregation of all grades given by major press & media outlets over videogame, and how it might differ from the \"playerscore\", aggregation of grades given by players on the same games.\n",
    "The main aim of the project has been to colect data over a large panel of consoles, in order to compare the games playable on each console, and then to be able to measure which consoles have the greatest amount of good games, both in terms of Metascore (good critics from the media) and Playerscore (positive critics from the player).\n",

    "\n",
    "The project has developed data research over various sources : public API, web scraping and merging from various available CSVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original idea was to scrap data from [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) , a popular public API centralising informations over 360K games, in order to create an ad hoc datasets over the research consoles.\n",
    "To measure sales performance of all consoles, the popular website [VGchartz.com](http://www.vgchartz.com/analysis/platform_totals/) provides an updated table over the sales of all major videogame consoles since the 1970s. That table has been scraped and transformed into an exploitable Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "Finally, in order to get information of Metacritics score, several CSVs providing information over the scores have been selected and merged together."
