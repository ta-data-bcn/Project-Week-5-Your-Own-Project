    "With the COVID crisis and the Black Lives Matter movement, there are increasing voices in the media talking about a growing disillusionment that drives a general social discomfort. Yuval Noah Harari wrote in his book \"21 lessons for the 21st century\" that liberalism is losing credibility since the latest financial crisis at the same time that the advances in information technology and biotechnology  are making us fear losing our jobs, our liberty and becoming irrelevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper I analyse whether it is true that discomfort has increased since the last financial crisis. For doing so, I focus on data for gatherings of 1000 people or more occurring all over the world (excluding the United States, where no extensive enough reliable data was found) and I try to determine whether the number of mass protests have indeed increase after 2010 compared to the prior 20 years of welfare state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand whether the approach of looking at global data is relevant, I also analyse the correlation between the number of protests and the country's level of freedom."

    "This could suggest that we protest about more different topics, however only a few get general engagement. And those topics that manage to engage, spread further than before. As a reference, the participation peak in the period 1990-2010 happened in 2003 and corresponded to the global \"No war against Irak\" demonstrations."

    "It does seem that the number of protests has increased since the financial crisis. People protest more times than in the glorious days of the welfare state and when a topic is engaging, it spreads wider.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, together with the fact that most mass protests seem to be triggered by disagreements with political behaviors, second Harari's thesis that liberalism might have lost credibility and that people are nervous in the current moment of revolutionary change brought by technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the level of freedom of a country does not affect significantly the ability of people to protest might well be related to this same technological evolution reaching all countries around the world, particularly the Internet and social media, which help to spread messages faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, we seem to be undergoing deep changes as a society, and if there was ever a moment in the past 30 years to express opinions and concerns that help to build a better future, it is certainly now."
